# Phase 2 Application Build - Summary

**Build Date:** October 10, 2025
**Package:** FaBCardDetector_Phase2_Windows.zip (12 MB)

## What's New in Phase 2

### Model Improvements
- **500 classes** (up from 100 in Phase 1)
- **98.9% mAP50** validation accuracy
- **92.1% mAP50-95** validation accuracy
- Trained on 33,300 images (30k synthetic + 3.3k random backgrounds)
- Transfer learning from Phase 1 weights for faster convergence

### Application Improvements
1. **Overlay Mode Fixed**
   - Now shows detection boxes in overlay mode (was transparent before)
   - Easier to debug what's being detected
   
2. **Card Preview Toggle**
   - New checkbox: "Show card preview on hover"
   - Can enable/disable card image popup
   
3. **Better Path Resolution**
   - Fixed card.json loading for both development and packaged versions
   - Works correctly with PyInstaller's temp folder structure
   
4. **Improved Card Name Matching**
   - Strips set codes (e.g., "Card_Name_WTR001" → "Card Name")
   - Better fuzzy matching for punctuation differences
   - More debug output for troubleshooting

## Installation Instructions (for Windows users)

1. Extract `FaBCardDetector_Phase2_Windows.zip`
2. Double-click `INSTALL_WINDOWS.bat`
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for dependencies to install
4. Double-click `RUN_DETECTOR.bat`
5. Configure settings and click "Start Detection"

## Testing Recommendations

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] GUI launches successfully
- [ ] Model loads without errors
- [ ] Card.json loads successfully (check console output)
- [ ] Both windowed and overlay modes work
- [ ] Detection boxes appear in both modes

### Card Preview Feature
- [ ] Hover over detected card shows preview
- [ ] Card images load from internet
- [ ] Preview positioning works correctly
- [ ] Toggle checkbox enables/disables preview
- [ ] Debug output shows card name matching

### Detection Quality
- [ ] Test on top 100 cards (should be excellent - Phase 1 knowledge retained)
- [ ] Test on cards 101-500 (new cards added in Phase 2)
- [ ] Compare windowed vs overlay mode detection (should be identical)
- [ ] Test with different confidence thresholds
- [ ] Test with real streaming footage vs static images

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Card Preview Not Working**
   - Check console output for "Loaded X cards from..." message
   - Verify internet connection (images load from online)
   - Check if card names match between model output and card.json

2. **Detection Accuracy Concerns**
   - Model shows 98.9% on synthetic data
   - Real-world performance may vary
   - Consider Phase 2.5 with enhanced augmentation if needed

3. **Performance**
   - 500 classes may be slower than 100 classes
   - Monitor FPS in the application
   - Lower confidence threshold = more processing

## Next Steps

### If Testing Goes Well
- Deploy to production
- Gather user feedback
- Start planning Phase 3 (1000 classes)

### If Issues Found
- Document specific failure cases
- Consider Phase 2.5 with enhanced training data:
  - Motion blur augmentation
  - Compression artifacts
  - Lighting variations
  - Glare/reflection simulation
